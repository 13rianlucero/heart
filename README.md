#### Note

> Initially, I developed the cpp files on my **Macbook**
>
> - compiled using clang++
> - used c++17
> - ran the executables in vscode integrated terminal
> - big million line text files were created and actually 1mil+ lines/characters
>
> However, when I run the executable on my **Windows** laptop
>
> - I havent setup clang++ on that laptop yet, so used g++ compiler and the cpp files still compile with no errors/warnings
> - used c++17
> - 
> - ran the executables in vscode integrated terminal
> - the output text file is empty, not a single character in it
> - it would seem the executable is not able to write to the output txt file
> - It is able to read from other plaintext files, however!
>
> I'm not sure why this is happening exactly, but i think it's one of the following reasons:
>
> - My current file explorer settings in WIndows 11 OS is not allowing the (.exe) program to write to the output text file
> - something having to do with the compiler? (i feel it's unlikely)
> - vscode settings differing between the laptops (also feels unlikely)
>
> *Not really in a rush to figure out why exactly it doesn't write to text files, but probably would be something I do later on.*
